# _alm.py

**Code Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python script (`_alm.py`) defines Python class bindings generated by the PyXB library. It's designed to parse XML documents conforming to the XML Schema Definition (XSD) likely found at `rttiPPTAlarms_v1.xsd`.
2.  **Technology:** It uses PyXB (Python XML Schema Bindings) version 1.2.6. PyXB takes an XSD and generates Python classes that mirror the XSD's structure, allowing developers to easily parse conforming XML into Python objects and vice-versa.
3.  **Namespace:** The script specifically handles elements and types defined within the XML namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/Alarms/v1`. The conventional prefix `alm` is often associated with this namespace in XML documents.
4.  **Core Functionality:** It provides functions (`CreateFromDocument`, `CreateFromDOM`) to parse XML input (string or DOM node) and create corresponding Python object instances based on the defined classes.
5.  **Data Structures:** The script defines Python classes that map directly to complex and simple types in the corresponding XSD:
    *   `AlarmID`: Represents a unique Darwin alarm identifier (maps to an XML string).
    *   `RTTIAlarmData`: Describes the *content* of a specific alarm being set. It contains the unique `id` of the alarm and details about *one* specific type of failure.
    *   `RTTIAlarm`: Represents the top-level alarm message. It indicates whether a *new* alarm is being set (`<set>`) or an *existing* alarm is being cleared (`<clear>`).

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Parsed**

This parser processes XML messages concerning alarms within the Darwin RTTI (Real Time Train Information) system. The key data points extracted are:

1.  **Alarm Operation Type:** Whether the message represents:
    *   **Setting a new alarm:** Indicated by the presence of a `<set>` element within the main `<RTTIAlarm>` structure.
    *   **Clearing an existing alarm:** Indicated by the presence of a `<clear>` element within the main `<RTTIAlarm>` structure.

2.  **Alarm Identifier (`AlarmID`):**
    *   A unique string identifier associated with each specific alarm instance.
    *   Parsed from the `id` attribute of the `<set>` element's content (`RTTIAlarmData`).
    *   Parsed from the content of the `<clear>` element when an alarm is cleared.

3.  **Alarm Details (when setting an alarm, within `RTTIAlarmData`):**
    *   **Alarm Type:** Exactly one of the following failure types will be present:
        *   **`tdAreaFail`:** Indicates a failure related to a specific Train Describer (TD) area.
            *   **Data Point:** The specific TD Area ID (`TDAreaIDType`, imported from `_ct`, likely a string code) that has failed.
        *   **`tdFeedFail`:** Indicates a failure of the *entire* Train Describer (TD) feed into the Darwin system. (The specific content type is `anyType`, often meaning its presence alone signifies the event).
        *   **`tyrellFeedFail`:** Indicates a failure of the "Tyrell" feed (another data source) into the Darwin system. (The specific content type is `anyType`, often meaning its presence alone signifies the event).

**In essence, the parser identifies:**

*   If an alarm is being created or removed.
*   The unique ID of the alarm being acted upon.
*   If an alarm is being created, the specific *type* of system failure (TD Area, TD Feed, or Tyrell Feed) and, if applicable, the specific TD Area involved.

# _ct.py

Okay, let's break down the provided Python script `_ct.py`.

**Analysis of `_ct.py`**

1.  **Purpose:** This script contains Python class bindings generated by the `PyXB` (Python XML Binding) library. It specifically defines Python representations for data types found within the XML Schema (XSD) located at `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v1`. This namespace is conventionally aliased as `ct` (Common Types).
2.  **Generation:** It was automatically generated by PyXB version 1.2.6 on March 5, 2025 (Note: The date seems to be in the future, likely just a placeholder or example in the file header).
3.  **Functionality:**
    *   It defines Python classes that correspond to simple and complex types defined in the `rttiPPTCommonTypes_v1.xsd` schema file.
    *   Each class typically inherits from a base PyXB data type (e.g., `pyxb.binding.datatypes.string`, `pyxb.binding.datatypes.short`, `pyxb.binding.datatypes.dateTime`).
    *   It includes constraints defined in the XSD (like length, pattern, min/max values) as PyXB facets (e.g., `_CF_maxLength`, `_CF_pattern`).
    *   It provides documentation strings (`_Documentation`) extracted from the XSD annotations, explaining the purpose of each type.
    *   It includes helper functions (`CreateFromDocument`, `CreateFromDOM`) which are standard PyXB utilities to parse an XML string or DOM object into instances of these generated Python classes.

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Parsed**

This script defines the fundamental data types used within the RTTI PushPort XML messages. It doesn't parse a *specific* message itself but provides the building blocks to do so. Here are the key data points (types) defined and what they represent:

In essence, this script defines the basic vocabulary (data types) needed to understand and process the structured information about train schedules, locations, times, operators, and real-time status updates provided by the RTTI PushPort feed.

# _ct2.py

Okay, let's analyze the provided Python code (`_ct2.py`).

**Code Analysis:**

1.  **Nature of the Code:** This Python file is **not** a manually written XML parser. It's a **PyXB binding module**. PyXB is a tool that automatically generates Python classes from an XML Schema Definition (XSD). These classes represent the structure and data types defined in the schema, allowing Python code to easily create, parse, and validate XML documents conforming to that schema.
2.  **Source Schema:** The code is generated based on an XML schema identified by the namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v2`. This indicates it deals with common data types for the **Thales Real Time Train Information (RTTI) PushPort system (Version 2)**, which is used for UK rail data. The `ct2` likely stands for "Common Types version 2".
3.  **Generation Details:** It was generated on `2025-03-05` (note: this date is in the future, possibly a placeholder or generation artifact) using PyXB version `1.2.6` and Python `3.11.2`.
4.  **Functionality:**
    *   It defines standard PyXB helper functions (`CreateFromDocument`, `CreateFromDOM`) to load XML data (from a string or a DOM object) and convert it into Python objects based on the bindings defined in this module.
    *   It primarily defines Python classes that correspond to specific data types within the `CommonTypes/v2` schema.
5.  **Specific Data Type Defined:** The *only* specific data type defined *within this provided code snippet* is `RSIDType`.

**Summary Report: Parsed Data Points in `_ct2.py`**

Based on the provided code snippet (`_ct2.py`), the parser (or more accurately, the PyXB binding module) is designed to handle the following specific data point from the Thales RTTI PushPort `CommonTypes/v2` schema:

1.  **Data Point:** `RSIDType`
    *   **XML Namespace:** `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v2`
    *   **Meaning:** Represents a **Retail Service Identifier (RSID)**.
    *   **Description:** This is an identifier used within the UK rail industry (specifically mentioned in relation to the "Darwin" system, which is the core of RTTI) to uniquely identify a train service or a portion of it.
    *   **Format:** It's defined as a **string**.
    *   **Constraints:**
        *   Minimum Length: 6 characters.
        *   Maximum Length: 8 characters.
    *   **Context:** The documentation notes it can represent either a base 6-character identifier or a full 8-character "portion identifier", depending on the data available in the Darwin system.

**Important Context:**

*   This file (`_ct2.py`) likely only defines *common base types*. A complete RTTI PushPort message (like train schedules, movements, delays) would involve many other data types defined in potentially *other* PyXB binding modules generated from different parts of the RTTI PushPort XSD schemas (e.g., schemas for schedule information, train movements, etc.).
*   Therefore, while this module defines how to parse and represent an `RSIDType`, it doesn't parse the entire train data structure on its own. It's a building block used by a larger application interacting with the RTTI PushPort feed.

In conclusion, this specific Python module provides the definition and parsing logic for the **Retail Service Identifier (`RSIDType`)**, a key identifier for train services within the UK RTTI system, enforcing its string format and length constraints (6-8 characters).

# _ct3.py

Okay, let's break down this PyXB binding module (`_ct3.py`).

**Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python file is automatically generated by PyXB (version 1.2.6). Its function is to create Python class representations for data types defined in an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file (`rttiPPTCommonTypes_v3.xsd`).
2.  **XML Namespace:** The module specifically handles types defined within the XML namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v3`. This namespace is associated with common data types used in the Thales RTTI (Real Time Train Information) PushPort system, version 3. The alias `ct3` is often used for this namespace in XML documents.
3.  **Functionality:** It allows developers to easily parse XML documents conforming to this part of the RTTI schema into Python objects and, conversely, to create XML from Python objects structured according to these definitions. The `CreateFromDocument` and `CreateFromDOM` functions facilitate this parsing.
4.  **Data Type Definitions:** The core of the module lies in the Python classes that inherit from `pyxb.binding.datatypes`. Each class represents a specific `simpleType` defined in the corresponding XSD. These classes include:
    *   The original XML type name (`_ExpandedName`).
    *   Documentation extracted from the XSD (`_Documentation`).
    *   Constraints (like length or value range) defined in the XSD (`_CF_maxLength`, `_CF_minLength`, `_CF_maxInclusive`, etc.).

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified by `_ct3.py`**

This PyXB module defines Python bindings for common data types used within the Thales RTTI PushPort v3 feed (namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v3`). These types primarily relate to train composition and status:

1.  **`FormationIDType`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a unique identifier for a specific train formation (the sequence and type of coaches making up a train).
    *   **Data Type:** String.
    *   **Constraints:** Must be between 1 and 20 characters long.

2.  **`LoadingValue`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the estimated passenger loading level of a train coach.
    *   **Data Type:** Unsigned Integer.
    *   **Constraints:** Must be a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive), representing a percentage.

3.  **`CoachNumberType`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the specific identifier or number assigned to a single coach within a train formation.
    *   **Data Type:** String.
    *   **Examples:** "A", "12".
    *   **Constraints:** Must be between 1 and 2 characters long.

4.  **`CoachClassType`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the class designation of a train coach.
    *   **Data Type:** String.
    *   **Examples:** "First", "Standard", "Mixed".
    *   **Constraints:** None specified beyond being a string.

In essence, this module provides the foundational building blocks for describing individual coaches and entire train formations, including their identity, class, and passenger load, within the RTTI PushPort data stream.

# _ct4.py

Okay, let's break down the provided PyXB binding module `_ct4.py`.

**Analysis of `_ct4.py`**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python module is automatically generated by PyXB (version 1.2.6). Its purpose is to create Python class representations for XML data structures defined in an XML Schema Definition (XSD). Specifically, it binds elements and types from the XML namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/CommonTypes/v4`.
2.  **Source Schema:** The bindings are derived from the namespace associated with Thales Group's Real Time Train Information (RTTI) PushPort system, specifically version 4 of its common types (`rttiPPTCommonTypes_v4.xsd`).
3.  **Functionality:** It provides Python classes (`ToiletType`, `ToiletStatus`, `ToiletAvailabilityType`) that correspond to types defined in the XSD. It also includes utility functions (`CreateFromDocument`, `CreateFromDOM`) to parse XML data conforming to this schema into instances of these Python classes.
4.  **Focus:** Based on the types defined *in this specific file*, the focus is on describing toilet facilities within train coaches.

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified by `_ct4.py`**

This PyXB module defines data structures for classifying information about **toilet facilities on trains**, specifically within the context of the Thales RTTI PushPort system (CommonTypes v4).

The key data points classified are:

1.  **`ToiletType` (Simple Type: String)**
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the *kind* or *type* of toilet available in a coach.
    *   **Data:** A string value.
    *   **Examples:** "Unknown", "None", "Standard", "Accessible".
    *   **Note:** The definition suggests it's an open string type, meaning other values might appear in the data even if not explicitly listed as examples here.

2.  **`ToiletStatus` (Simple Type: Enumeration)**
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the *operational status* of a toilet.
    *   **Data:** A restricted string value (enumeration).
    *   **Allowed Values:**
        *   `Unknown`: The status is not known.
        *   `InService`: The toilet is operational.
        *   `NotInService`: The toilet is not operational (out of order).

3.  **`ToiletAvailabilityType` (Complex Type with Simple Content)**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a combined view of toilet availability, incorporating both its type and its status.
    *   **Structure:**
        *   **Content/Value:** Represents the *type* of the toilet, using the `ToiletType` definition (e.g., "Standard", "Accessible"). Defaults to "Unknown" if not provided in the source XML.
        *   **Attribute (`status`):** Represents the *operational status* of the toilet, using the `ToiletStatus` enumeration.
            *   **Default:** If the `status` attribute is omitted in the source XML, it defaults to `InService`.
    *   **Combined Meaning:** This type allows specifying, for example, an "Accessible" toilet (value) that is currently "NotInService" (status attribute).

**In essence, this module allows XML data describing train coach toilets to be represented in Python by classifying:**

*   The **type** of toilet (e.g., Standard, Accessible).
*   The **operational status** of that toilet (e.g., In Service, Not In Service).
*   A **combined structure** (`ToiletAvailabilityType`) that holds both the type (as its main value) and the status (as an attribute), with defined defaults for missing information.

# _fm.py

Okay, let's break down the provided PyXB binding module `_fm.py` for RTTI PushPort Train Formations.

**Analysis Context:**

*   **Purpose:** This Python module (`_fm.py`) defines Python classes that directly map to XML elements and types described in an XML Schema Definition (XSD).
*   **Source Schema:** The bindings are generated from `rttiPPTFormations_v1.xsd` for the namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/Formations/v1`.
*   **Domain:** The data relates to UK Real Time Train Information (RTTI), specifically focusing on "Train Formations" (the sequence and type of coaches making up a train) and associated loading information.
*   **Technology:** PyXB allows Python applications to easily parse XML documents conforming to this schema into Python objects and serialize Python objects back into conformant XML.

# _fm2.py

Okay, let's break down the `_fm2.py` PyXB binding module for train railway formation data.

**Analysis:**

This Python module (`_fm2.py`) is automatically generated by PyXB (version 1.2.6) from an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file (`rttiPPTFormations_v2.xsd`). Its purpose is to create Python classes that mirror the structure defined in the XSD for the namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/Formations/v2`. This allows developers to easily parse XML documents conforming to this schema into Python objects and vice-versa.

The module defines Python classes corresponding to the complex types and elements within the `fm2` namespace, focusing specifically on train formation data (the physical layout and characteristics of coaches in a train).

**Key Data Structures (Complex Types):**

1.  **`ScheduleFormations`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the complete set of train formation information associated with a *single train schedule*.
    *   **Key Identifier:** `rid` (Attribute, Required): The RTTI (RealTime Train Information) unique identifier for the specific train schedule this formation data applies to. This links the formation details to a particular train service.
    *   **Content:** Contains a list (`formation`) of one or more `Formation` objects. This allows for different formations potentially applying to different parts of the same schedule (though often there's just one).

2.  **`Formation`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Describes a *single, specific train formation* (a sequence of coaches). This might apply to the entire service defined by the `rid` or just a portion of it.
    *   **Key Identifier:** `fid` (Attribute, Required): A unique identifier for *this specific formation data* itself.
    *   **Source Information:**
        *   `src` (Attribute, Optional): A string indicating the source system or entity that provided this formation data.
        *   `srcInst` (Attribute, Optional): The specific instance ID of the RTTI source system, if applicable.
    *   **Content:** Contains one `coaches` element, which holds a `CoachList`.

3.  **`CoachList`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as a container for the list of individual coaches that make up a specific `Formation`.
    *   **Content:** Contains a list (`coach`) of one or more `CoachData` objects, ordered presumably from one end of the train to the other (though the schema doesn't strictly enforce order meaning, it's implied).

4.  **`CoachData`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Provides details about an *individual coach* within a `Formation`.
    *   **Key Attributes:**
        *   `coachNumber` (Attribute, Required): The identifier for the coach within the train (e.g., "A", "B", "1", "2").
        *   `coachClass` (Attribute, Optional): The class of service offered in the coach (e.g., "First", "Standard", "Mixed").
    *   **Content:** Contains an optional `toilet` element.
    *   **Toilet Information:** `toilet` (Element, Optional): Describes the availability and type of toilet facilities in the coach (e.g., "Unknown", "None", "Standard", "Accessible").

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified**

This PyXB binding module (`_fm2.py`) provides Python structures to represent and access the following key data points about train formations:

1.  **Schedule Association:**
    *   `rid`: Uniquely identifies the train schedule to which the formation information pertains (within `ScheduleFormations`). **(Required)**

2.  **Formation Identification & Source:**
    *   `fid`: Uniquely identifies a specific instance of formation data (within `Formation`). **(Required)**
    *   `src`: Identifies the system or source that provided the formation data (within `Formation`). (Optional)
    *   `srcInst`: Identifies the specific instance of the source system (within `Formation`). (Optional)

3.  **Coach Composition:**
    *   An ordered list of coaches comprising a formation (represented by the `coach` list within `CoachList`, nested inside `Formation`).

4.  **Individual Coach Details:**
    *   `coachNumber`: The specific identifier or label for each coach within the formation (within `CoachData`). **(Required)**
    *   `coachClass`: The service class of the individual coach (e.g., First, Standard) (within `CoachData`). (Optional)
    *   `toilet`: The type and availability of toilet facilities within the individual coach (within `CoachData`). (Optional)

**Hierarchy:**

The data is structured hierarchically:

`ScheduleFormations` (keyed by `rid`) -> contains -> `Formation`(s) (keyed by `fid`) -> contains -> `CoachList` -> contains -> `CoachData`(s) (keyed by `coachNumber`)

In essence, this module allows systems to understand the physical makeup of a specific train service (`rid`), including the sequence, identity (`coachNumber`), class, and facilities (`toilet`) of each coach within its defined formation (`fid`).

# _for.py

Okay, let's break down this PyXB binding module (`_for.py`) for RTTI PushPort Forecasts v3.

This module defines the Python object structure corresponding to XML messages containing real-time train forecast updates according to the `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/Forecasts/v3` namespace.

**Summary Report: Key Data Points in `_for.py` (RTTI PushPort Forecasts v3)**

The module primarily defines structures to represent **Train Status (TS)** updates, which provide real-time forecast information for specific train services.

**1. Train Service Identification and Overall Status (`TS` type):**
    *   **Service Identifiers:**
        *   `rid`: **RTTI unique Train Identifier**. The primary real-time ID for the service run. (Required)

        *   `platsrc`: Source of the platform info ('P'lanned, 'A'utomatic, 'M'anual).
        *   `conf`: Boolean flag indicating if the platform is confirmed.
        *   `platsup`: Boolean flag indicating if the platform display is suppressed.
        *   `cisPlatsup`: Boolean flag indicating if suppression was set by a CIS/Darwin Workstation.
    *   **Other Location-Specific Status:**
        *   `suppr`: Boolean flag (default: false) indicating if the service is suppressed (e.g., cancelled call) at *this specific location*. (Optional)
        *   `length`: Train length (number of coaches) at this location (default: 0, meaning unknown). (Optional, Type: `TrainLengthType` from `_ct`)
        *   `detachFront`: Boolean flag (default: false) indicating if stock is detached from the *front* of the train at this location. (Optional)

**3. Time Data Details (`TSTimeData` type within `arr`, `dep`, `pass`):**

**In essence:**

This module defines the structure for receiving detailed, real-time updates about individual train services. Each update (`TS`) identifies a train (`rid`, `uid`, `ssd`) and provides potentially service-wide information (`LateReason`, `isReverseFormation`). The bulk of the data consists of updates for specific locations (`TSLocation`) along the route, including scheduled times (`wta`, `pta`, etc.), real-time forecasts/actuals for arrival/departure/pass events (`TSTimeData` containing `et`, `at`, `delayed` etc.), platform details (`PlatformData`), and other status flags like suppression or train length.

# _sch2.py

    *   `fd` (False Destination): A TIPLOC indicating a different destination to be shown to passengers at this specific point. Present on `OR` and `IP`.

**3. `Association`**

Describes a relationship between two different train services (`rid`s) at a specific location.

*   **Structure:** Contains a `main` element and an `assoc` element, both of type `AssocService`.
    *   `AssocService`: Represents one of the services in the association, identified by its `rid` (Required) and including relevant working (`wta`/`wtd`/`wtp`) and public (`pta`/`ptd`) times *at the association point*.

        *   `NP`: Next-Part (e.g., connects to the next part of a journey on a subsequent day)
    *   `isCancelled`: Boolean indicating the association *itself* is cancelled (the trains may still run but won't join/split/link as planned). Default: false.
    *   `isDeleted`: Boolean indicating the association record *itself* has been deleted. Default: false.

**4. `DeactivatedSchedule`**

A simple message indicating that a specific schedule (`rid`) is no longer considered active in the real-time system and further updates for it should not be expected unless it gets reactivated.

*   **Key Attribute:**
    *   `rid`: The RTTI ID of the schedule being deactivated. (Required)

**In Summary:**

# _sch3.py

Okay, let's break down this PyXB binding module (`_sch3.py`) for the RTTI PushPort Schedules v3 schema.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python module is generated by PyXB from an XML Schema Definition (XSD). Its goal is to provide Python classes that directly map to the elements and types defined in the `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/Schedules/v3` namespace (aliased as `sch3`). This allows developers to easily parse XML documents conforming to this schema into Python objects and create/manipulate these objects to generate valid XML.
2.  **Source Schema:** The bindings are for the RTTI (Real Time Train Information) PushPort feed, specifically the "Schedules" part, version 3, provided by Thales Group.
3.  **Dependencies:** It imports other PyXB binding modules (`_ct`, `_ct2`, `_ct3`), likely containing common data types used across different parts of the RTTI schema (e.g., time types, location types, identifiers).
4.  **Core Structure:** The schema defines a primary structure `Schedule` which contains a sequence of "calling points". These calling points represent different types of stops or passing locations along a train's journey.
5.  **Calling Point Types:** The module defines distinct classes for different types of calling points:
    *   **Passenger vs. Operational:** Passenger points (`OR`, `IP`, `DT`) include public timings (`pta`, `ptd`), while Operational points (`OPOR`, `OPIP`, `OPDT`) focus on working timings (`wta`, `wtd`). Operational points are typically not shown on public displays but are relevant for railway operations.
    *   **Origin vs. Intermediate vs. Destination:** Differentiates the start (`OR`, `OPOR`), middle (`IP`, `OPIP`, `PP`), and end (`DT`, `OPDT`) points of a service or operational leg.
    *   **Stopping vs. Passing:** Stopping points (`OR`, `OPOR`, `IP`, `OPIP`, `DT`, `OPDT`) have arrival and departure times, while Passing points (`PP`) only have a passing time (`wtp`).

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified by `_sch3.py`**

# _sm.py

Okay, let's break down this PyXB binding module (`_sm.py`) for UK Rail RTTI PushPort Station Messages.

**Analysis Context:**

*   **Purpose:** This Python module is generated by PyXB from an XML Schema Definition (XSD). Its role is to allow Python programs to easily parse, validate, and create XML documents conforming to the `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/StationMessages/v1` namespace.
*   **Data Domain:** The module specifically handles "Station Messages" within the UK's Real Time Train Information (RTTI) PushPort system. These are typically operational messages intended for display at stations or for use by information systems.
*   **Technology:** PyXB creates Python classes that directly map to the elements and types defined in the XSD.

**Summary Report: Key Data Points Classified by `_sm.py`**

This PyXB module defines the structure for representing individual station messages broadcast via the RTTI PushPort feed. The central data structure is the `StationMessage`. Here are the important data points it classifies:

1.  **`StationMessage` (Overall Message Container):**
    *   This is the root element type representing a single station message.
    *   **`id` (Attribute):** A mandatory `integer` uniquely identifying this specific message instance.
    *   **`cat` (Attribute):** A mandatory classification of the message's **Category**, using the `MsgCategoryType` enumeration.
    *   **`sev` (Attribute):** A mandatory classification of the message's **Severity**, using the `MsgSeverityType` enumeration.
    *   **`suppress` (Attribute):** An optional `boolean` flag (defaulting to `false`) indicating if associated train running information should be suppressed from public view due to this message.

2.  **`Station` (Target Stations):**
    *   This element appears one or more times within a `StationMessage`.
    *   It specifies which station(s) the message applies to.
    *   **`crs` (Attribute):** A mandatory **Computer Reservation System (CRS) code** (e.g., "KGX" for London King's Cross). This uses the `CrsType` imported from the common types (`_ct`) module and is the key identifier for the station.

3.  **`Msg` (Message Content):**
    *   This element contains the actual text content of the station message.
    *   It allows for simple HTML-like formatting:
        *   **`p` (Element):** Represents a paragraph within the message. Can contain plain text and `a` elements.
        *   **`a` (Element):** Represents an HTML anchor (hyperlink).
            *   **`href` (Attribute):** A mandatory attribute containing the URL for the link.
            *   The text content of the `a` element is the link text itself.

4.  **`MsgCategoryType` (Enumeration - Message Category):**
    *   A restricted set of string values classifying the *type* or *subject* of the message.
    *   Possible Values:
        *   `Train`: Related to specific train services.
        *   `Station`: Related to station facilities or general station information.
        *   `Connections`: Related to passenger connections.
        *   `System`: Related to the RTTI system itself or other technical systems.
        *   `Misc`: Miscellaneous messages not fitting other categories.
        *   `PriorTrains`: High-priority message relating to trains.
        *   `PriorOther`: High-priority message for non-train subjects.

5.  **`MsgSeverityType` (Enumeration - Message Severity):**
    *   A restricted set of string values classifying the *urgency* or *impact* of the message.
    *   Possible Values:
        *   `0`: Normal / Lowest severity.
        *   `1`: Minor.
        *   `2`: Major.
        *   `3`: Severe / Highest severity.

**In Essence:**

The module defines a structure where each `StationMessage` has a unique ID, a defined category and severity, an optional suppression flag, applies to one or more specific stations (identified by CRS code), and contains the actual message text which can include basic paragraph and hyperlink formatting. The enumerations (`MsgCategoryType`, `MsgSeverityType`) provide controlled vocabularies for classifying the messages.

# _status.py

Okay, let's analyze the provided PyXB binding module `_status.py` for the Thales RTTI Push Port Status schema.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python module (`_status.py`) is generated by PyXB based on an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file (`rttiPPTStatus_v1.xsd`). Its purpose is to provide Python classes that represent the XML elements and types defined in the `http://thalesgroup.com/RTTI/PushPortStatus/root_1` namespace. This specific namespace deals with the **status and connection setup phase** of the Real-Time Train Information (RTTI) Push Port feed. It's *not* for the train movement data itself, but for managing the connection *to* that data feed.
2.  **Namespace:** The primary XML namespace handled is `http://thalesgroup.com/RTTI/PushPortStatus/root_1`.
3.  **Core Functionality:** The module defines Python classes that allow developers to easily:
    *   Parse incoming XML status messages from the RTTI Push Port system into Python objects.
    *   Create Python objects representing status/setup messages and serialize them into valid XML to send *to* the RTTI system.
4.  **Key XML Elements Defined:** The module defines bindings for the following top-level XML elements, which represent distinct message types within this status protocol:
    *   `status:PPReqVersion`: Used by the client to declare the versions of the RTTI data schemas it supports.
    *   `status:PPStatus`: Used by the server (Push Port) to send status information, heartbeats, or error messages back to the client, particularly during the initial connection setup phase.
    *   `status:PPConnect`: A signal element, likely sent by the server to indicate that the setup phase is complete and the connection is ready to transition to sending actual train data using the agreed-upon schemas.

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified**

Based on the PyXB module, the RTTI Push Port Status schema (`http://thalesgroup.com/RTTI/PushPortStatus/root_1`) classifies the following important data points related to connection setup and status:

1.  **Client Schema Version Declaration (`PPReqVersion` element):**
    *   **Push Port Data Schema Version (`version` attribute):** A mandatory string indicating the version (namespace) of the main RTTI Push Port data schema the client supports. (Min length 1).
    *   **Push Port Timetable Schema Version (`ttversion` attribute):** A mandatory string indicating the version (namespace) of the RTTI Push Port Timetable schema the client supports. (Min length 1).
    *   **Push Port Timetable Reference Data Schema Version (`ttrefversion` attribute):** A mandatory string indicating the version (namespace) of the RTTI Push Port Timetable Reference data schema the client supports. (Min length 1).

2.  **Server Status/Heartbeat/Error (`PPStatus` element):**
    *   **Status Code (`code` attribute):** A mandatory string code identifying the status or error type. (Min length 1, Max length 32). This is the primary indicator of the connection state or a specific problem.
    *   **Status Message (Element content):** An optional string providing a human-readable description of the status or error. (Max length 128). This elaborates on the `code`.

3.  **Connection Ready Signal (`PPConnect` element):**
    *   This element itself acts as a data point. Its presence signals the successful completion of the handshake/setup phase and that the server is switching to the main data feed schema. It appears to be an empty element used purely for signalling.

**In essence, this part of the RTTI protocol focuses on:**

*   **Version Negotiation:** Ensuring the client and server agree on the schemas to use for subsequent data exchange (train movements, timetables, reference data).
*   **Connection Lifecycle Management:** Providing status updates, error reporting, and a clear signal (`PPConnect`) for when the connection is fully established and ready for real-time data.

# _ta.py

Okay, let's break down the `_ta.py` PyXB binding module for the Train Alerts (`ta`) namespace.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python module (`_ta.py`) is generated by PyXB to create Python objects that represent XML data conforming to the schema defined by the namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/TrainAlerts/v1`. This namespace specifically deals with "Train Alerts" within the Thales RTTI (Real Time Train Information) Push Port system.
2.  **Schema Source:** The bindings were generated from an XML Schema Definition file located at `/home/bence/DATA-228/stomp-client-python/ppv16/rttiPPTTrainAlerts_v1.xsd`.
3.  **Dependencies:** It imports definitions from another binding module `_ct` (likely "Common Types"), specifically using `_ct.RIDType` and `_ct.UIDType`. It also uses standard Python types like `string`, `boolean`, and `date`.
4.  **Core Data Structure:** The central piece of data defined is the `TrainAlert` complex type. This represents a single alert message concerning train services.
5.  **Enumerated Types:** The module defines specific, restricted sets of values for certain fields:
    *   `AlertAudienceType`: Specifies who the alert is intended for (`Customer`, `Staff`, `Operations`).
    *   `AlertType`: Specifies the nature of the alert (`Normal`, `Forced`).

**Summary Report: Important Data Points Classified by `_ta.py`**

This PyXB module provides Python bindings for parsing and representing Train Alert data from the RTTI Push Port feed (namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/TrainAlerts/v1`).

The key data points classified are:

1.  **Train Alert (`TrainAlert`):** The main container for a single alert instance. It includes:
    *   **Alert Identifier (`AlertID`):** A unique string identifying this specific alert.
    *   **Affected Services (`AlertServices`):** A container holding one or more specific train services impacted by this alert.
    *   **Distribution Flags:** Boolean indicators specifying preferred distribution channels:

    *   **Alert Type (`AlertType`):** Classifies the alert's nature using `AlertType` (Normal or Forced).
    *   **Origin Information (Optional):**
        *   `CopiedFromAlertID`: The ID of a previous alert this one was copied or derived from.
        *   `CopiedFromSource`: The source system of the alert this one was copied from.

2.  **Alert Service (`AlertService`):** Represents a specific train service instance affected by the alert. Each service is identified by:
    *   **Realtime Identifier (`RID`):** The RTTI Realtime ID of the train service (Attribute, type `_ct.RIDType`).
    *   **Unique Identifier (`UID`):** The Train UID (Unique Identifier) from the schedule (Attribute, type `_ct.UIDType`).
    *   **Schedule Start Date (`SSD`):** The date the scheduled service starts (Attribute, type `date`).
    *   **Relevant Location (`Location`):** One or more specific locations (e.g., station TIPLOC codes) associated with the alert for this particular service (Element, type `string`). Can appear multiple times for a single `AlertService`.

In essence, this module defines the structure for receiving detailed alerts about specific train services, including the message content, intended audience, type, source, distribution hints, and precise identification of the train services and relevant locations involved.

# _td.py

Okay, let's break down the `_td.py` PyXB binding module for the Thales RTTI PushPort TD (Train Describer) Data.

**Analysis Summary Report: PyXB Module `_td.py` (TD Data v1)**

This Python module (`_td.py`) defines the data structures for processing XML messages conforming to the `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/TDData/v1` namespace, specifically focusing on Train Describer (TD) data within the UK Rail Real Time Train Information (RTTI) Push Port feed.

The module primarily defines structures related to correcting train identification information within the TD system.

**Key Data Structures and Important Data Points:**

1.  **`TrackingID` (Complex Type):**
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a message indicating a *correction* to a train's identity (Tracking ID or headcode) that was previously misreported within a specific TD berth.
    *   **Key Data Points within `TrackingID`:**
        *   `berth` (Element):
            *   **Type:** `FullTDBerthID` (see below).
            *   **Meaning:** Identifies the specific TD berth (a section of track in the signalling system) where the train with the incorrect ID was identified. It includes both the berth ID and the area it belongs to.
            *   **Note:** The documentation explicitly mentions this is the berth *reported* and the train might have moved since.
        *   `incorrectTrainID` (Element):
            *   **Type:** `TrainIdType` (imported from `_ct` module, likely a string pattern for headcodes).
            *   **Meaning:** The train identity (headcode) that was *incorrectly* reported by the TD system for the train in the specified `berth`.
        *   `correctTrainID` (Element):
            *   **Type:** `TrainIdType` (imported from `_ct` module).
            *   **Meaning:** The *correct* train identity (headcode) that *should* be associated with the train in the specified `berth`.

2.  **`FullTDBerthID` (Complex Type):**
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a complete identifier for a TD berth, combining the berth ID itself with the area it belongs to.
    *   **Key Data Points within `FullTDBerthID`:**
        *   **(Simple Content Value):**
            *   **Type:** `TDBerthIDType` (imported from `_ct` module, likely a string).
            *   **Meaning:** The identifier for the specific TD berth (e.g., "0123").
        *   `area` (Attribute):
            *   **Type:** `TDAreaIDType` (imported from `_ct` module, likely a 2-character string).
            *   **Meaning:** The identifier for the TD Area (a logical grouping of berths within the signalling system, e.g., "EK") that contains this berth. This attribute is *required*.

**Overall Classification:**

This module classifies data specifically related to **Train Describer identity corrections**. It allows the system to receive messages that pinpoint:

*   A specific location on the network (`area` + `berth` ID).
*   The train identity that was wrongly associated with that location (`incorrectTrainID`).
*   The train identity that should have been associated with that location (`correctTrainID`).

It relies on common data types (`TrainIdType`, `TDAreaIDType`, `TDBerthIDType`) defined in an external module (`_ct.py`), suggesting these identifiers follow standardized formats used elsewhere in the RTTI system.

# _tor.py

Okay, let's break down this PyXB binding module for RTTI Train Order data.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Purpose:** This Python module (`_tor.py`) defines Python classes that directly map to XML elements and types described by an XML Schema Definition (XSD). It's specifically designed to parse and represent data conforming to the `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/TrainOrder/v1` namespace. This namespace relates to Real-Time Train Information (RTTI) "PushPort" messages, specifically focusing on the "Train Order" at a particular location (platform).
2.  **Technology:** It uses PyXB, a library for generating Python bindings from XML Schemas. This allows developers to work with the XML data as native Python objects rather than parsing XML trees directly.
3.  **Dependencies:** It relies on a common types module (`_ct`), likely containing definitions for basic RTTI data types like `TiplocType`, `CrsType`, `PlatformType`, `RIDType`, `TrainIdType`, `WTimeType`, and `RTTITimeType`.
4.  **Core Structure:** The main data structure defined is `TrainOrder`, which represents a message about the sequence of trains expected at a specific platform.

**Key Data Structures and Points:**

1.  **`TrainOrder` (Root Element/Message Type):**
    *   **Represents:** The overall Train Order message for a specific location.
    *   **Location Identification (Attributes):**
        *   `tiploc`: The Timing Point Location code (e.g., "WATRLOO") where the order applies (Required).
        *   `crs`: The Computer Reservation System (CRS) code (3-letter station code, e.g., "WAT") where the order applies (Required).
        *   `platform`: The specific platform number (e.g., "10") where the order applies (Required).
    *   **Action (Mutually Exclusive Elements):**
        *   `set`: Contains the actual train order sequence if this message is setting or updating the order. Uses the `TrainOrderData` type.
        *   `clear`: An empty element indicating that the current train order for this platform should be cleared.

2.  **`TrainOrderData` (Contained within `TrainOrder.set`):**
    *   **Represents:** The actual sequence of trains.
    *   **Sequence (Elements):**
        *   `first`: The first train expected at the platform (Required). Uses the `TrainOrderItem` type.
        *   `second`: The second train expected (Optional). Uses the `TrainOrderItem` type.
        *   `third`: The third train expected (Optional). Uses the `TrainOrderItem` type.
    *   **Implicit Meaning:** Defines the expected order (1st, 2nd, 3rd) of trains arriving/departing/passing the specified platform.

3.  **`TrainOrderItem` (Used within `TrainOrderData`):**
    *   **Represents:** A single train within the ordered sequence.
    *   **Train Identification (Mutually Exclusive Elements):**
        *   `rid`: The RTTI Internal Identifier (RID) for the train schedule. Used *if* the train exists in the Darwin (RTTI) timetable.
            *   **Associated Times (Attributes on `rid` element):** When `rid` is used, it carries scheduled time information *relevant to this specific location*:
                *   `wta`: Working Time of Arrival.
                *   `wtd`: Working Time of Departure.
                *   `wtp`: Working Time of Pass.
                *   `pta`: Public Time of Arrival.
                *   `ptd`: Public Time of Departure.
        *   `trainID`: The Train ID (Headcode, e.g., "1A23"). Used *if* the train is *not* in the Darwin timetable (e.g., a special working, freight train not in the passenger schedule feed).

**Summary Report:**

This PyXB module (`_tor.py`) provides Python bindings for processing RTTI Train Order messages defined by the namespace `http://www.thalesgroup.com/rtti/PushPort/TrainOrder/v1`. These messages communicate the expected sequence of trains at a specific platform.

**Important Data Points Classified:**

1.  **Message Context:**
    *   **Location:** Identifies the specific place the train order applies using mandatory attributes:
        *   `tiploc`: Timing Point Location code (e.g., "KGX").
        *   `crs`: Station CRS code (e.g., "KGX").
        *   `platform`: Platform number (e.g., "1").
    *   **Action Type:** Indicates whether the message is:
        *   **Setting/Updating:** An order (via the `set` element).
        *   **Clearing:** A previously set order (via the `clear` element).

2.  **Train Sequence (if Setting/Updating):**
    *   Provides an ordered list of up to three trains:
        *   `first`: The first expected train (mandatory).
        *   `second`: The second expected train (optional).
        *   `third`: The third expected train (optional).

3.  **Individual Train Identification:**
    *   **Method 1 (Darwin Timetable):**
        *   `rid`: The RTTI unique schedule identifier.
        *   Associated Scheduled Times (at the specified `tiploc`):
            *   `wta` (Working Arrival)
            *   `wtd` (Working Departure)
            *   `wtp` (Working Pass)
            *   `pta` (Public Arrival)
            *   `ptd` (Public Departure)
    *   **Method 2 (Non-Darwin Timetable):**
        *   `trainID`: The train headcode (operational identifier).

In essence, this module allows a system to understand which trains (identified by RID or Headcode) are expected, and in what order (1st, 2nd, 3rd), at a specific station platform, along with their scheduled times if identified by RID. It also allows for the clearing of this information.
